      <h1>About Survival Nexus</h1>
      <p>Practical skills. Vetted suppliers. Honest reviews. Built for real life outside.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>I’m Alexander Gordon Petitjean — a designer, maker, and problem-solver who turns lived experience into future-ready solutions. As a double below-knee amputee with a background in AI-assisted prototyping, outdoor survival education, and hands-on construction, I build tools and environments where humans can thrive — especially in unpredictable situations.

Whether I’m designing an adaptive decking structure using GPT-augmented geometry, creating digital ecosystems for survival knowledge, or refining biomechanical efficiency one step at a time, I combine curiosity with resilience. I believe accessibility isn’t a constraint — it’s innovation waiting to happen.

Welcome to my work: where creativity, technology, and survival intersect. We help people build self-reliance with field-tested knowledge and gear. Our focus spans EMT/trauma readiness, firecraft &amp; shelter, treasure-hunting tools, and minimalist vagabond travel. We publish step-by-step guides, maintain a vetted supplier directory, and run transparent gear tests you can replicate.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <div class="guide-preview">
        <article>
          <h3>Editor &amp; Lead Tester</h3>
          <p>Outdoor generalist with a bias for evidence and repeatable experiments. Field background includes wilderness first aid drills, backcountry travel, tool repair, and lightweight systems. We actively seek feedback from emergency responders and experienced hobbyists.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Perspective Matters</h3>
          <p>Accessibility and inclusive design are core values. We consider different body types and abilities, and we note gear usability with gloved hands, cold-weather dexterity, one-handed operation, and weight-bearing constraints.</p>

      <h2>How We Test</h2>
      <div class="guide-preview">
        <article>
          <h3>Standard Protocol</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Define use case:</strong> scenario, environment, failure modes.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish metrics:</strong> e.g., time-to-occlusion, strikes-to-ignite, runtime, durability cycles, mass/volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Run trials:</strong> minimum 3 trials per metric; note variance and conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Document:</strong> photos, notes, and configuration details.</li>
            <li><strong>Publish:</strong> results with pros/cons and explicit trade-offs.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Ratings Are Explanations</h3>
          <p>Numbers without context mislead. We pair ratings with the “why” and call out edge cases where a lower-rated tool still wins for a specific job.</p>

      <p>Survival Nexus recommends equipment because it works in real field conditions we have tested or observed. If a link is an affiliate link (Amazon, Avant, etc.), it will be marked.</p>
      <p>You pay the same price — affiliate commission helps fund more field guides, testing, and documentation.</p>
