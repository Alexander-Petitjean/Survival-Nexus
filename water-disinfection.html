    <h1>Emergency Water Disinfection 101</h1>
    <p class="intro">Learn the science and the practice—how filtration, chemicals, and UV neutralize microbial threats.</p>

    <h2>1. Understanding Waterborne Hazards</h2>
    <p>Protozoa (Giardia, Cryptosporidium), bacteria (E. coli, Vibrio), and viruses (Hep A, Norovirus) are the main biological contaminants. They differ in resistance to chlorine and UV—understand that difference before treatment.</p>

    <h2>2. Filtration: Mechanical Barriers</h2>
    <p>Filters physically remove protozoa and bacteria; pore size below 0.2 μm is ideal. Note that viruses require finer treatment (chemical or UV).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hollow fiber filters</strong>—lightweight, backflushable.</li>
      <li><strong>Activated carbon</strong>—adsorbs chemicals and taste compounds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Chemical Disinfection</h2>
    <p>Chlorine dioxide oxidizes cell walls and proteins; iodine denatures enzymes. Explain contact time (30 min minimum, 4 °C doubles time) and biological mode of action.</p>

    <h2>4. UV Sterilization</h2>
    <p>Ultraviolet light at 254 nm damages nucleic acids—prevents replication. Works best in clear water; turbidity reduces efficacy. Always prefilter cloudy water.</p>

    <h2>5. Field Exercise</h2>
    <p>Collect water from two sources—turbid and clear. Treat both with the same method. Observe clarity, taste, and note time to complete treatment. Discuss what changed and why.</p>
