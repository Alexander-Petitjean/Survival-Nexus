        <p>Content on Survival Nexus is for educational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and it is not a substitute for professional training or certification. Activities described on this site—firecraft, use of edged tools, remote travel, rescue techniques—entail real risk of injury or death.</p>
        <p>Always seek appropriate training (e.g., Wilderness First Aid/WFR/EMT), follow local laws and land-use rules, and use certified equipment where required. In an emergency, contact local emergency services immediately.</p>

  <h2>AI-Generated Media</h2>
  <p>
    Some images, graphics, and illustrations on Survival Nexus are created with the help of

  <p>
    AI-generated media on this site is <strong>reviewed and approved by a human</strong> before it goes live.
    Images are conceptual and should not be treated as documentary evidence of real events, locations,
